# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.instranalshort}} 
{: #getting_started_instranalshort}

The {{site.data.keyword.instranalshort}} service leverages IBM Algorithmics' sophisticated financial models to price and compute analytics on securities.
{:shortdesc}

With thirty years of financial engineering expertise, IBM Algorithmics' pricing models are trusted by the world's largest financial institutions to meet their risk, performance, and regulatory needs. 

The {{site.data.keyword.instranalshort}} service supports the current computation of the theoretical or market calibrated valuation, and all relevant associated analytics, for investment securities such as equities, fixed income, and derivatives.

## Before you begin

The following steps show you how to obtain access to the {{site.data.keyword.instranalshort}} service and invoke API methods. To use the {{site.data.keyword.instranalshort}} REST API, it is important that you understand the basics of RESTful web services and JSON representations.

You must install cURL before you can use the service.

## Step 1: Getting your credentials

1. Create an instance of the service.
2. Review the service instance access credentials, similar to the following example:
```
{
  "accessToken": "<api-key>",
  "uri": "<service-url>"
}
```

## Step 2: Get the value of an instrument

To use the following example, replace api-key with your service key and service-url with the URL for your service.

```
curl -X GET -H "X-IBM-Access-Token: <api-key>" <service-url>/api/v1/instrument/<id-of-instrument>
```

{:codeblock}

The following is an example of a response to a successful request:

```
[
  {
    "instrument": "<id-of-instrument>",
    "scenario": "Base Scenario",
    "values": [
      {
        "THEO/Price": "100 USD",
        "date": "2017/03/09"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
Example using 'POST'. Using 'POST' is preferred if you are requesting a large number of analytics, or if there are commas within the analytic names.

```
curl -X POST -H "X-IBM-Access-Token: <api-key>" -d '{"analytics":["THEO/Value","THEO/Price", "THEO/Effective Duration"]}' <service-url>/api/v1/instrument/<id-of-instrument>
```

{:codeblock}

The following is an example of a response to a successful request:

```
[
  {
    "instrument": "<id-of-instrument>",
    "scenario": "Base Scenario",
    "values": [
      {
        "THEO/Effective Duration": "6.6194 T",
        "THEO/Price": "101.9994 USD",
        "THEO/Value": "103.3580 USD",
        "date": "2017/03/15"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

A list of instruments is available [here](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/analytics/solutions/en/fintech/Sample_Instrument_Universe.xlsx).

The following table contains 'Field Name' values that you can pass to the API for the measures, and the asset classes (Fixed Income, Equity, or Derivative) that they apply to:

|Measure Name|Field Name|Fixed Income|Equity|Derivatives|
|------------|----------|------------|------|-----------|
